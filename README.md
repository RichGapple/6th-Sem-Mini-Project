Welcome to our little hell hole. This is an unfinised project where god only knows when will it get finished, To get started

EPMA\front-end  --> frontend code

EPMA\pyprogs    --> core python program files which contain all algos and libraries

EPMA\pyprogs\myPackman.py -->  import/installs all the python dependencies to your setup 

EPMA.py --> this file automatically runs the above file and starts the server

EPMA\Pendrive\Inkscape   --> Inkscape software used for png to svg conversion

EPMA\Pendrive\NodePortable  --> Node JS software for running backend server

Main issues:-
1) PNG Created has too much whitespace boarder (Fixed)
2) Algorithm efficiency takes a toll due to that useless white boundary (Found out to be not true, Need to figure out the root cause still)
3) Tried giving 5 images(W/O White boarder) to be sorted, Program froze/Program takes too long to run indicating issues somewhere in the code
   

Thanks for letting me rant
