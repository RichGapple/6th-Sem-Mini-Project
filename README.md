Welcome to our little hell hole. This is an unfinised project where god only knows when will it get finished, To get started
EPMA\front-end  --> frontend code
EPMA\pyprogs    --> core python program files which contain all algos and libraries
EPMA\pyprogs\myPackman.py -->  import/installs all the python dependencies to your setup 
EPMA.py --> this file automatically runs the above file and starts the server
EPMA\Pendrive\Inkscape   --> Inkscape software used for png to svg conversion
EPMA\Pendrive\NodePortable  --> Node JS software for running backend server

Main issues:-
1) PNG Created has too much whitespace boarder
2) Algorithm efficiency takes a toll due to that useless white boundary

Thanks for letting me rant
